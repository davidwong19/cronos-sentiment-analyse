4.0,"-Sphere: find like -minded people who all share passion for Microsoft Data Platform. You can also be yourself, long live diversity in personalities! -Klein on Human Size Company (43P) with the backings and benefits of a large Cronos Group initiative and autonomy are by definition in the Consultantcy Role and in our company DNA. You learn quickly and keep learning through the variation in assignments. Consultancy is certainly not one -sided with us: something is wrong, then you can count on the willingness to listen., - We focus on Microsoft and monitor that limit not to lose our specialists role. Some people prefer to go wide and less deep. - We are still in growth process in terms of structure. If you like tight structures, then we are not your right employer. In any case, we love freedom than rules, so we may never be a control paradise :-) - If you are looking for the highest salary package, we are not for you. We believe in humanity, a good balance work/life and giving and making just about everything discussable. Our wage package fits in with that philosophy.",20/01/2020,glassdoor,Kohera

5.0,"Bernard is a great employer. He is very easy to work with because he is good at communicating with you. He is good at conveying his thoughts and vision to you. He is very hands on and schedules regular meeting that will allow you to know where you stand and what is expected of you. He does not micromanage you., Bernard is very social and talkative because of this sometimes your meeting will run long.",12/01/2021,glassdoor,PreviewLabs
2.0,"- Somewhat flexible work week (as long as you work a minimum of 38 hours, you can take off time during the day as needed to go to appointments, etc. and just work later another day to make up for it)., - micromanagement is OUT OF CONTROL- little business sense- frequently late/ missing deadlines- leadership has no time management skills- willing to listen* to other's opinions/ideas, but rarely willing to change.... I could make quite a long list. **Hire people to do their jobs and then let them do their jobs.** There is no reason that there should be so many meetings with employees all week to check in on what they are doing and review it. It's an incredible waste of time on everyone's part. There is a reason you are always late, missing events on your schedule, missing deadlines and working into the wee hours of the night - and causing others to do so with you. Develop trust with your employees. Make clear and understand that they will come to you or the PM with questions if needed, but hours a day get wasted unnecessarily. Pay attention to your employees. Work life balance... many aren't getting it. You want to be friends with your employees and expect them to hang out with you in your/their free time, but don't do much to earn that friendship. Practice listening; interrupt less; give people the chance to respond - this includes during [potential] client calls. Be patient. If you're going to be a global business, understand that business is conducted differently in various countries and learn the differences. R-E-S-P-E-C-T.",30/08/2020,glassdoor,PreviewLabs
