3.0,"Competitive salary and some nice extras. Helpful office staff. Stable job as you are employed full-time by Cronos, even the client ends your contract, you are back on the bench until they find another suitable client and project you fit it.Diversity of colleagues, multi-nationals.Home internet subscription, mobile subscription, meal vouchers are included in the salary (cash), public transport abonnement., Treated consultants working on-site (at EU institutions) poorer than the ones sitting at the HQ. No offers for career developments, no trainings offered, only Linkedin Learning courses which you had to take while your clients were not operating. Hiring unqualified staff sometimes could ruin the whole team. (eg: hiring so-called senior dev while the person was clearly unqualified and eventually left the company and the project with a lot of mess behind for the rest of the team to fix).But this was before they rebranded themselves to Cronos Europa. Hopefully things changed after the new management.",09/02/2022,glassdoor,Cronos International
