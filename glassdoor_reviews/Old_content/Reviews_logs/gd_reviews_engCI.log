    "opinion": "Competitive salary and some nice extras. Helpful office staff. Stable job as you are employed full-time by Cronos, even the client ends your contract, you are back on the bench until they find another suitable client and project you fit it. Diversity of colleagues, multi-nationals. Home internet subscription, mobile subscription, meal vouchers are included in the salary (cash), public transport abonnement, Treated consultants working on-site (at EU institutions) poorer than the ones sitting at the HQ. No offers for career developments, no trainings offered, only Linkedin Learning courses which you had to take while your clients were not operating. Hiring unqualified staff sometimes could ruin the whole team. (eg: hiring so-called senior dev while the person was clearly unqualified and eventually left the company and the project with a lot of mess behind for the rest of the team to fix). But this was before they rebranded themselves to Cronos Europa. Hopefully things changed after the new management.",

A lot of opportunities for IT employees and freelancers within the EU institutions. Permanent contracts for employees. Flex Income Plan, Like all the rest of consultancies, and maybe fewer cons.",

    "opinion": "This is a consultancy company that works mainly for the European institutions through the framework contract that they have. Working for the institutions is good especially if you want later pursuit a career as a civil servant , this could be a good starting step into the EU buble. Usually it is possible to work as a Freelancer or Employee i would advice freelance because cronos adds nothing to the table if you are competent in what you do, in IT you won't be out of job and the European Institutions are a very stable client. Position in the European Institutions. Overall if a career withing the EU Buble is what you seek, it might be a suitable company if you work freelance,Lack of Transparency, do not explain how things work, no career support nothing. No Culture whatsoever Poor on boarding, as said before nothing is really clear with them. As with other consultancy companies at the end of the day, you are a number for them. Low Salary if you are an employee. Adds nothing in terms of value, only if the contract with the client expires they will find something for you and you won't be out of a job. European Institutions in technological terms are behind in many aspects and IT is not their priority, but this depends of where you are placed",
