Originally, the group was founded for and by technology people with the explicit intention of helping those people grow, if desired, up to and including entrepreneurship.
 In the meantime, this mission statement has been broadened and the group has been enriched with people from the creative sector who communicate well with the 'business people' and who work perfectly together with De Cronos Groep IT people to arrive at the most creative and technologically best solution for customers. .
 The group is therefore continuously looking for creative, driven people and is always willing to listen to innovative ideas from potential entrepreneurs.
