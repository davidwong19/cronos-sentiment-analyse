626fa925ee00b319fdd25e75,NARATO,16/02/2021,"Cool projects with cool people,As this is my first job, I don't have much experience with different companies, their mentality, work-life balance, ... But what I do know is that I've enjoyed my time thus far at Narato, working on cool projects for massive companies as well as impactful projects at small companies, learning every step of the way. Sometimes working a little late cause ""this is some cool stuff we're building"" and other days stopping a little early to get a drink, a chat, a laugh, ...

One of the harder parts for me personally, is the ever changing landscape that we developers call work. Narato tries to stay close to the border where the change is happening, taking steps in new and sometimes undocumented terrain. Whilst it is very cool to work with new tech, it can also be frustrating. The flipside of this coin is the great feeling that comes with fiddling with something new and it working afterwards, the great feeling of broadening your horizon. My personal nature wouldn't reach for all this new tech, so I have Narato to thank for presenting me the opportunity and giving me a little nudge.

A final and quite important point when broadening your horizon and going on an adventure, is the captains steering the ship. And let me tell you, Narato has some excellent captains, placing themselves among the crew and not shying away from getting their hands dirty or having a pint. Genuine people that actually do care about the co-workers around them. Approachable when you have a problem that needs sorting out, whether it's something technical, practical, personal, ..., they'll do their very best to find a solution with you.Frequently changing work-environment",5,indeed
