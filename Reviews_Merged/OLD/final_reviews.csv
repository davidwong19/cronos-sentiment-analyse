I could make quite a long list. **Hire people to do their jobs and then let them do their jobs.** There is no reason that there should be so many meetings with employees all week to check in on what they are doing and review it. It's an incredible waste of time on everyone's part. There is a reason you are always late, missing events on your schedule, missing deadlines and working into the wee hours of the night - and causing others to do so with you. Develop trust with your employees. Make clear and understand that they will come to you or the PM with questions if needed, but hours a day get wasted unnecessarily. Pay attention to your employees. Work life balance... many aren't getting it. You want to be friends with your employees and expect them to hang out with you in your/their free time, but don't do much to earn that friendship. Practice listening; interrupt less; give people the chance to respond - this includes during [potential] client calls. Be patient.

386,BeWire,"Attractive commercial vehicle and unlimited fuel card were the best ""perks"" that you receive as an employee, accompanied by largely very enthusiastic colleagues. Insights into how a company is best not run., Management does not reconcile the truth to tell the possibilities within the company: promises during application about training and growth potential, offering of assignments, interpretation of knowledge sharing and social events are in STRICE contrast with reality. If you are not in the Brussels region, you will never be able to work virtually close to home, even if this is assured with every application. Assignments are extended several times without your knowledge, several times you are not even aware of the duration of your assignment at the customer. Also from management itself the duration changes, sometimes your assignment is extended for 24 hours by 6 months. Men also keeps a ""better than the rest"" feeling close to the heart, although they always have nothing to prove and do not invest too little In the effective growth of their employees. Education consists of watching videos - or you will be placed directly to the customer for the Vuur test - without any feedback from learned knowledge or extensive check -in management. Internal tooling is non -existent but is ""sold"" to applicants as fully worked out. So I am not sure what is better, on the one hand, heartache and stress that is accompanied by an employee like this is not worth it at all, because the way of way of Working within this company is unfortunately an example of how it should not be done. But on the other hand, that in itself is a good lesson to learn (see my last plus point).",21/07/2019,1,glassdoor,0.9776,positive
