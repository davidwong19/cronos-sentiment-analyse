Originally, the group was founded for and by technology people with the explicit intention of helping those people grow, if desired, up to and including entrepreneurship.
 In the meantime, this mission statement has been broadened and the group has been enriched with people from the creative sector who communicate well with the 'business people' and who work perfectly together with De Cronos Groep IT people to arrive at the most creative and technologically best solution for customers. .
 The group is therefore continuously looking for creative, driven people and is always willing to listen to innovative ideas from potential entrepreneurs.

Stable job as you are employed full-time by Cronos, even the client ends your contract, you are back on the bench until they find another suitable client and project you fit it. Diversity of colleagues, multi-nationals. Home internet subscription, mobile subscription, meal vouchers are included in the salary (cash), public transport abonnement, Treated consultants working on-site (at EU institutions) poorer than the ones sitting at the HQ. No offers for career developments, no trainings offered, only Linkedin Learning courses which you had to take while your clients were not operating. Hiring unqualified staff sometimes could ruin the whole team. (eg: hiring so-called senior dev while the person was clearly unqualified and eventually left the company and the project with a lot of mess behind for the rest of the team to fix). But this was before they rebranded themselves to Cronos Europa. Hopefully things changed after the new management.",glassdoor

Working for the institutions is good especially if you want later pursuit a career as a civil servant , this could be a good starting step into the EU buble. Usually it is possible to work as a Freelancer or Employee i would advice freelance because cronos adds nothing to the table if you are competent in what you do, in IT you won't be out of job and the European Institutions are a very stable client.

Overall if a career withing the EU Buble is what you seek, it might be a suitable company if you work freelance,Lack of Transparency, do not explain how things work, no career support nothing. No Culture whatsoever Poor on boarding, as said before nothing is really clear with them. As with other consultancy companies at the end of the day, you are a number for them. Low Salary if you are an employee. Adds nothing in terms of value, only if the contract with the client expires they will find something for you and you won't be out of a job.
