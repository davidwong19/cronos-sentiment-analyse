Lots of opportunities to launch ideas as new competence centers or re-shift your career if you desire., Although not openly discussed leadership of the units obviously foster an insane level of internal competitiveness. People are encouraged to do actions that are borderline legal when doing contract negotiations. Leadership has far to less respect for their employees and have no problem abusing their position on the employment market to brake ones career if you go against their standards.
