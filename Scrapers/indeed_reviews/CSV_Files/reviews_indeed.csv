"5,0","A Typical day at work:- plan posts for the day/coming days- read up on emails and social media posts- discuss PR & marketing strategies- planning for our Game Expo: 1UP- making visuals for posts to share- talking with the devs and giving feedback on their games What I've learned:new tools to use, news skills (photoshop, Premiere...), content planning. putting deadlines on others to get my content in time. Management:Great superior, doesn't not feel like a typical boss/employee relationship. Open to suggestions and feedback.  Workplace culture:Flexible hours, expecting only for your job to be done by reasonable deadlines, fun colleagues who like to chat during lunch and play a game afterwards. Fun group to hang out with. The hardest part of the job:managing my time. there is a lot to be done and I always see ways to improve my work so the stopping point is hard to determine. Bybthe very nature of the job (social media) it also means I have to put in some work outside of office hours The most enjoyable part of the job:Working with a great team, in a company working on VIDEO GAMES: my lifelong dream. It's a culture I've been invested in since pretty much forever and now I get to work in the industry.",13/03/2019,indeed,Cronos Interactive
