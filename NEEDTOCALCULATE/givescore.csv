0,iCredit,I work as a consultant for iCredit since a few years. As a consultant I have been working at different companies for a certain period of time what has offered me the opportunity to give expertise and learn at the same time. For me this has been a very rewarding experience. I highly recommend anyone to pursue a career as a consultant at iCredit.,16/12/2018,5,indeed
1,iCredit,I've been working as a student for iCredit for a couple of months and I really think it's an ideal job. A very nice familiar working atmosphere where there's also room for a joke now and then and an interesting and instructive range of tasks where taking the initiative is definitely stimulated. What I also appreciate enormously is the flexibility that I get. I am totally free to choose which days I come to work!,16/12/2018,5,indeed
2,iCredit,iCredit is a very nice employer. They think and and live with their employees. They make sure that the consultants get together once a month to strengthen the team spirit. They always make sure that this meeting takes place in a nice place. They put a lot of effort in training and growing their staff. I am very happy that I chose iCredit as an employer!,16/12/2018,5,indeed
3,iCredit,I myself have worked for iCredit with great pleasure and dedication. The management leaves enough room for personal development and at least as important personal input in the development of the company this for both the project consultants and the employees at the head office. For iCredit Consultants of course to the extent possible a healthy commuting distance is always taken into account. iCredit is a company in growth where the growing pains have already been eliminated and make way for professional development. The salary package of iCredit is composed based on experience and potential. From experience the overall package is above the market average for both Consultants and Head Office staff.,11/12/2018,5,indeed
4,iCredit,iCredit is a very pleasant company to work for. It has grown significantly in recent years with very quality employees. The focus on a good working atmosphere remains important. On the other hand our team of recruiters is daily looking for candidates with the right profile and attitude to match the demand of our customers.,11/12/2018,5,indeed
5,iCredit,Been working at iCredit for quite some time now and never regretted it for a second.Very committed to the people you are not treated like a number and you get the chance to prove yourself in several areas.Training both internal and external is also on the program so no time to rust.No time to waste sending your CV....,10/12/2018,5,indeed
6,iCredit,"As a consultant I was placed with a nice company and was able to prove what I had to offer, but once in inside sales, I died of the boring and numbing job content. I had to cash in on projects that invariably remained unfinished by various ICT companies. Bad atmosphere among colleagues and lots of bullying. A boss who lacks people-skills and lets himself be played by his lovely team of maids. Actually I was not acting as a credit controller but as a salesman of their credit management software.",27/10/2013,1,indeed
