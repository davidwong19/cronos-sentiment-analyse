iCredit,I've been working as a student for iCredit for a couple of months and I really think it's an ideal job.

What I also appreciate enormously is the flexibility that I get. I am totally free to choose which days I come to work!,16/12/2018,5,indeed
iCredit,iCredit is a very nice employer. They think and and live with their employees. They make sure that the consultants get together once a month to strengthen the team spirit. They always make sure that this meeting takes place in a nice place. They put a lot of effort in training and growing their staff. I am very happy that I chose iCredit as an employer!,16/12/2018,5,indeed
iCredit,I myself have worked for iCredit with great pleasure and dedication. The management leaves enough room for personal development and at least as important personal input in the development of the company this for both the project consultants and the employees at the head office. For iCredit Consultants of course to the extent possible a healthy commuting distance is always taken into account. iCredit is a company in growth where the growing pains have already been eliminated and make way for professional development. The salary package of iCredit is composed based on experience and potential. From experience the overall package is above the market average for both Consultants and Head Office staff.,11/12/2018,5,indeed

iCredit,"As a consultant I was placed with a nice company and was able to prove what I had to offer, but once in inside sales, I died of the boring and numbing job content. I had to cash in on projects that invariably remained unfinished by various ICT companies. Bad atmosphere among colleagues and lots of bullying. A boss who lacks people-skills and lets himself be played by his lovely team of maids. Actually I was not acting as a credit controller but as a salesman of their credit management software.",27/10/2013,1,indeed
